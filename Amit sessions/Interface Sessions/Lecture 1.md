* What is Embedded System is (Definition)
* Sob vs Soc (performance - size - cost - Power consumption -   configurability - Prototyping vs Mass production )
* Basic component of Embedded system (Microcontroller - I/O - Memory)
* Processor vs microprocessor vs CPU
* MICROCONTROLLER VS MICROPROCESSOR
* Processor Component :
	* Control unit  
	* Instruction Encoder
	* Instruction Format & Instruction set
	* ALU
* Which is better ISA with 100 instruction or 1000 instruction (CISC vs RISC) (performance - cost - size `ISA Types (Hardwired & Programmed)` -Power consumbtion )
* Instruction Cycle (Exclude MAR / MBR) for  von-nuemon / Harvard (pipeline)
* Execution cycle (Pipelining)
* Memory types (
                           volatile  ---> Dram & Static Ram
                           Hyberid ---> nvram ( programmed/ using battary) 
                            non-volatile  )
* Masked Rom / Otp Rom / Eprom / EEprom / Flash Rom  
* Flash vs Rom (Performance / Accesssing / Cost / Endurance)
* Startup Code / Linker
* Processor & Memory (address bus / control bus / Data Bus)
