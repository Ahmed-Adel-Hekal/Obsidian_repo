* Revisit instruction cycle 
* Explain addressing Modes
* explain MAR & MDR 
* Case when Address mode is not direct  and direct  [[[Computer Organization | Different Instruction Cycles - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-instruction-cycles/)]]
* Port Mapped / Memory Mapped ( speed / programming complexity)
* clock system types (RC/Crystal/Ceramic)
* compare between 3 types (Accuracy/Cost/Settling time/ noise immunity)
* Compilation Process
* preprocessor directives (define/undef/include/warning/error/paragma).
* (if/elif/else/ifdef/ifundef/endif)
* bit operations 
* bitmath_lib (Task to make set bit, clear bit, toggle bit, and read bit as  
functions and then as macros)
*C keywords. (30min)*  
* Const difference between when using it with global and  local variable (which one can change by pointer)  
* Volatile when and why to use it.  
* Types of optimizations.  
* Enum  
* Typedef  
* Difference between typedef and `# define`

• Standard type definitions (STD_Type.h)  
• uint8, uint16 and uint32 and other for the signed integer  
• simple program using this file and macros they made in  
previous lab

Make a program that’s counts number of zeros (bit)  
between two ones using the macro they implement
